name: themis
description: "Review code with an independent, adversarial eye — correctness, security, and quality — as a pass separate from whoever wrote it. Use when the user says 'review this', 'is this correct', 'check my code', 'audit', or before merging non-trivial changes. Triggers on 'review', 'audit', 'is this right', 'find bugs', 'before I merge', 'code review'. The reviewer is never the author."

# themis — weigh it fairly

Themis holds the scales of divine order and weighs without favor. Review is the pass that catches what building missed — and **the author is the worst judge of their own work**, because they review the code they *meant* to write, not the code on the page. So `themis` runs as a distinct pass, ideally by a fresh context, never self-approved in the same breath the code was authored.

## What to weigh — three scales

1. **Correctness** — does it do what it claims, and what happens at the edges? Empty input, nulls, concurrency, off-by-one, the error path, the case the happy path ignored. Trace the actual logic; don't pattern-match "looks fine."
2. **Security** — trust boundaries validated, no secrets in code or logs, injection/traversal/SSRF where untrusted input flows, authz on the real path. (For a deep pass, route to a dedicated security lens.)
3. **Quality** — clarity over cleverness, duplication that should be shared, a simpler path missed (`lethe`), naming that lies, comments that state *why* not *what*.

## The discipline

- **Adversarial, not confirmatory.** Try to *break* the change, not to bless it. "What input makes this wrong?"
- **Rank by severity**, most-dangerous first — a crash-on-empty beats a style nit.
- **Verify each finding before reporting it.** A confident wrong review finding costs trust; confirm the failure is real (the input, the state, the line) before you raise it. Don't cry wolf.
- **Concrete over vague** — "fails when `items` is empty at line 42" beats "add error handling."

## Concrete wiring

- **`oh-my-claudecode`** → `code-reviewer` (severity-rated), `critic` (thorough multi-perspective), `security-reviewer` (OWASP/secrets).
- **`superpowers`** → `requesting-code-review` / `receiving-code-review`.
- **The `code-review` skill** if present, or a fresh subagent handed the diff and told to find what's wrong.

Pairs as the gate after `daedalus`/`hydra` and before `charon` — nothing gets ferried across until it's been weighed.

<!-- pantheon: the missing half of "separate your passes". Routes to review agents; the discipline is adversarial, severity-ranked, self-verified, reviewer≠author. -->
